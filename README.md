Default Grafana dashboards for inspectIT

inspectIT provides a set of preconfigured dashboards that can be imported into a Grafana instance to visualize inspectIT data out of the box.

### Preconfigure Datasource in Grafana
The default dashboards provided on this page have been created with Grafana *version 4.0.0*. These dashboards may be incompatible with older versions of Grafana.
When importing the dashboards, please ensure to select a data source which uses a database that is also used by inspectIT to store long-term data.

For more information about monitoring using inspectIT can be found in our documentation:
